# CODSOFT-2 SALES PREDUCTION
Introduction:
Introduce the project and its context. Mention that this project was completed during your internship at Codsoft and that the goal was to predict sales using certain data.

Task Description:
Explain the Sales Prediction task you were assigned. Describe the problem you were addressing, the significance of predicting sales, and the overall objective of the project.

Data:
Describe the dataset you used for the Sales Prediction task. Explain the relevant features in the dataset, such as the input variables (e.g., time, products, demographics) and the target variable (sales). If possible, provide a link to the dataset source.

Approach:
Detail the approach you took to tackle the Sales Prediction task. Explain the steps you followed, including data preprocessing, feature selection/engineering, model choice, and how you handled any challenges related to the nature of sales data.

Code Overview:
Provide an overview of your code structure. List the main scripts or files you used and briefly explain what each of them does in the sales prediction pipeline.

Feature Engineering:
Discuss any feature engineering techniques you applied to enhance the predictive power of the model. This could include aggregating data, creating new features, or dealing with missing values.

Model Selection:
Explain the machine learning or statistical models you explored for sales prediction. Discuss the rationale behind your choices, whether you used regression, time series models, or any other methods.

Evaluation Metrics:
Describe the metrics you used to evaluate the performance of your sales prediction model. Discuss why you chose those specific metrics and how well your model performed according to those metrics.

Results:
Present the results of your sales prediction. Include insights gained from the analysis, any trends or patterns you identified, and whether your model's predictions aligned with actual sales data.

How to Run the Code:
Provide instructions for others to run your code on their own machines. Include details about any dependencies, setup instructions, and how to execute the code to make sales predictions.

Conclusion:
Summarize your experience working on the Sales Prediction task. Discuss any key takeaways, lessons learned, and future improvements you would consider for the project.
